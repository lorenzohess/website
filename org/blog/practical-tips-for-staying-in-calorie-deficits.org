* Practical Tips For Staying In Calorie Deficits
1. If your calorie limit is <2000, have only two meals. They can be bigger, and will be more psychologically rewarding that three smaller meals. Also, eating a small meal can feel limiting and raises temptations. Three smaller meals only amplifies these feelings, so avoid that by having two bigger ones.
2. If you're doing two meals, use a 1:2 breakfast:dinner calorie ratio. The big dinner will feel rewarding.
3. Low calorie toppings: spices, soy sauce.
4. Don't weigh too often, i.e. once a day. Weighing less often, but seeing a bigger weight drop, is more psychologically rewarding. Twice a week could mean seeing a rewarding 2lb drop each weigh-in (2% loss per week at 200lb).
5. Don't set a limit on eating green vegetables. I don't know the science, but I have a hard time imagining these would cause weight gain, and even slow weight loss. Even if you're doing several hundred calories of greens.
