** Completed
These projects have achieved at least most of their goals.
*** Academic Projects
1. Physics BA Honors Thesis, 2023: https://digitalcollections.bowdoin.edu/view/4961/: reuse of N95 FFRs helps mitigate the effects of shortages. UV-C exposure is an ideal method for the decontamination necessary for FFR reuse. We design and program a ray tracing simulator in MATLAB to characterize the distribution of scattered photons in N95 FFRs.
2. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/dante-site-backend][Commedia Word Counts Website]]: search for words in the /Divine Comedy/, along with their counts and frequencies.
3. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/eddy-current-brakes-ergometer][Eddy Current Brake Ergometer for PHYS 3010]]
4. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/me3310-stretcher-cad][Folding Stretcher CAD Model for ME 3310]]
5. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/xml-commedia][XML Commedia]]: Dante's /Divine Comedy/ encoded as XML, down to each word.
6. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/es-1310-cad-files][CAD Files for ES 1310]]
*** Software
1. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/arch-awesomewm-rice][AwesomeWM Desktop Rice for Arch Linux]]: configuration and scripting for the Awesome Window Manager and other desktop environment tools for Arch Linux.
2. [[https://github.com/lorenzohess/qubes-awesomewm-rice][AwesomeWM Desktop Rice for Qubes OS]]: configuration and scripting for the Awesome Window Manager and other desktop environment tools for Arch Linux.
3. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/divina-commandline][Divina Commandline]]: very basic CLI tools for interacting with the /Divine Comedy/ from the CLI.
4. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/xml-orlando-furioso][XML Orlando Furioso]]: Ariosto's /Orlando Furioso/ encoded as XML, down to each word.
*** Mechanical
**** 3D Modeling
1. [[https://github.com/lorenzohess/pill-gate-kirkland-393914][Pill Gate Gadget]]: increases the convenience with which one can retrieve a single Vitamin D pill from Costco's Item =393914= bottle.
2. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/fruit-fly-liquid-trap][Fruit Fly Liquid Trap]]: simple 3D model of a fruit fly trap.
**** Laser Cutting
1. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/greek-alphabetex][Greek Alphabet in LaTeX]]: aka "Greek AlphabeTeX", a reference to the LaTeX greek alphabet letters.
2. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/self-complementary-graphs-gift][Self-Complementary Graphs]]: visualization of fourteen self-complementary graphs (n = 1, 4, 5, 8).
*** Sports
1. [[https://gitlab.com/lorenzohess/water-polo-crash-course][Water Polo Crash Course]]: a crash course in water polo, intended as review for players with some experience.
** In Progress
These projects have not achieved suitable goals and I am currently working on them. There are a lot on the list, and I usually work on some while thinking about solutions for others.
** Design Phase
