<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If your calorie limit is &lt;2000, have only two meals. They can be bigger, and will be more psychologically rewarding that three smaller meals. Also, eating a small meal can feel limiting and raises temptations. Three smaller meals only amplifies these feelings, so avoid that by having two bigger ones.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re doing two meals, use a 1:2 breakfast:dinner calorie ratio. The big dinner will feel rewarding.</li>
<li>Low calorie toppings: spices, soy sauce.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t weigh too often, i.e. once a day. Weighing less often, but seeing a bigger weight drop, is more psychologically rewarding. Twice a week could mean seeing a rewarding 2lb drop each weigh-in (2% loss per week at 200lb).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t set a limit on eating green vegetables. I don&rsquo;t know the science, but I have a hard time imagining these would cause weight gain, and even slow weight loss. Even if you&rsquo;re doing several hundred calories of greens.</li>
