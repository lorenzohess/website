<h1 class="title">Computer Setup Rationale</h1>
<p>
Most important computer usage principle:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An eye-level monitor, a well-positioned and comfortable keyboard, a mouse, and a desk are each critical for productivity.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Premises:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A laptop has no eye-level monitor</li>
<li>A laptop has an ill-positioned keyboard</li>
<li>A laptop has an uncomfortable keyboard</li>
<li>A laptop has no mouse</li>
</ol>

<p>
From Premises (1), (2), (3), and (4), it follows that a laptop is highly unproductive. Thus, its usage in this configuration should be minimized. If it is used, it should be used on a desk. You should deliberately do work that requires low effort when working on a laptop.
</p>

<p>
A laptop&rsquo;s purpose should be a portable computer which is brought to and used at existing desks with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse as mentioned above, i.e. a desk at work or at home.
