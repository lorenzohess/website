<p>
This is a dangling paragraph, and it needs fixing.
<img src="../img/dangling-paragraph.jpg" alt="dangling-paragraph.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
As you can see, one word &ldquo;dangles&rdquo; off the end of the paragraph: that is, the paragraph&rsquo;s last line is spans less than half the page. This example showcases the ugliest case, with one word dangling.
</p>

<p>
This needs fixing because it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Creates ugly whitespace.</li>
<li>Is slightly jarring to read.</li>
<li>Inflates the length of your writing, even if you don&rsquo;t mean to, which is wrong. Readers may think it&rsquo;s deliberate.</li>
<li>When left unaddressed, creates the appearance that you either don&rsquo;t pay enough attention to detail to notice this or you don&rsquo;t care.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Benefits of fixing include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The inverses of reasons 1-4.</li>
<li>Shortened writing is often better than the original, particularly if the original is only your first draft.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org1477d18"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> My Approach</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
I find the best approach to shortening the paragraph is to work backwards through the paragraph. Start by shortening the final sentence. If that cannot be shortened, or if the shortened version doesn&rsquo;t fix the dangle, then go on to shortening the penultimate sentence. I find this approach has two benefits:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you&rsquo;re fixing the dangle right after writing the paragraph then the most recent sentence you will have written will be the final one. Your intended meaning of that sentence is still fresh in your mind and it will be easier to rework than the previous ones.</li>
<li>You minimize potential reworking of subsequent sentences to ensure coherence with the shortened one. Let&rsquo;s say you change the first sentence. You will then have to read, and potentially edit, all the subsequent sentences to make sure they still make sense in context of the shortened first sentence. These edits can have cascading effects which require even more work: editing the second sentence to cohere with the first may require editing the third, and so on. If you start with shortening the final sentence, you&rsquo;ll still have to re-read the paragraph, but the likelihood of edits to previous sentences is much lower. This is because the typical paragraph architecture involves sentences which build on previous sentences. The main exception to this is the topic sentence, which may mention concepts introduced in later sentences.</li>

<h3 id="orgf14b431"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Strategies for Shortening Text</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Strategies for quickly shortening a paragraph include:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Remove filler words, such as &ldquo;very&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Find the longest word and see if it can be replaced with a shorter word.</li>
<li>Find several short words and replace them with a single word. This single word itself may be a bit long, but it&rsquo;ll probably be shorter than the several short words.</li>
<li>Find awkward phrases and make them less awkward. Awkward writing correlates with extra words, so fixing an awkward phrase will likely shorten the paragraph.</li>
<li>Find a conjunction and replace it with a period, i.e. split one sentence into two. You save space by replacing a word with a period. Often, this makes your writing more emphatic, which is nice.</li>
<li>Replace a negation with the positive form.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-1">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s apply <b>Strategy 1</b> and make these edits: &ldquo;very popular &rarr; popular&rdquo; and &ldquo;kind of sharp &rarr; sharp&rdquo;. Now our paragraph looks like:

</p>

<p>
We have fixed the dangle!
</p>

<p>
But we can do better. Let&rsquo;s apply <b>Strategy 2</b> and make these edits:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;take into consideration the fact that&rdquo; → &ldquo;note that&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="org70fca84"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.2.</span> More Notes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-2">
<p>
You may need to play with different combinations of strategies. Suppose that you can fix the dangle by applying 1 and 2 together or by applying 4. Applying 1, 2, and 4 all together would remove too much and result in a new, dangling paragraph, so you can&rsquo;t do that. You thus have to weigh 1 vs. 2. Perhaps 2 changes the meaning a bit too much, so you apply 1. Or perhaps 1 detracts from deliberate emphasis, so you apply 2.
</p>

<p>
This task can be mentally daunting because you have to critically analyze your writing with the purpose of finding your bad writing. You will often notice, when applying this technique, that most, if not all, sentences in your paragraph can be shortened. Although fixing the entire paragraph will require additional work, you will have improved it greatly. Also, in my experience, it&rsquo;ll take only one to ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
You may then feel the urge to check other paragraphs. If you&rsquo;re pressed on time, but still want to do this, the best bang for your buck, in terms of writing clarity, will be to apply strategy 4, and then strategy 3. Filler words are tempting to remove, but awkward phrasing is much more obtrusive to the reader.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you may find that applying these strategies results in a new paragraph which still dangles! At this point, you have a few options:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Iteratively apply the strategies to fix the dangle. Just because you applied them once doesn&rsquo;t mean they can&rsquo;t be applied again. After all, your new paragraph is a different piece of writing with its own context, and the strategies may remain applicable.</li>
<li>Re-read the paragraph and see if you&rsquo;ve removed too much. Add stuff back.</li>
<li>Merge the new paragraph with another one. This is often possible if you&rsquo;ve shortened two adjacent paragraphs a lot. Note that if your new paragraph now only has a few sentences, it probably shouldn&rsquo;t be a paragraph anymore and should be merged into another paragraph anyway.</li>
</ol>

<p>
fixed paragraph looks much better, and is slightly better written:
