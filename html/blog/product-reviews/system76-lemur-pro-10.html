<h1 class="title">System76 Lemur Pro 10</h1>
<p>
<b>Background:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bought in January 2021</li>
<li>In use probably 6-12 hours per day, on average, since then</li>
<li>PopOS for 3 months</li>
<li>Qubes OS for 3.5 years</li>
<li>Arch Linux for 1.25 years to the present, as of writing</li>
<li>Kept in backpack of briefcase
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also during travel</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Specs:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CPU: Intel i5-1135G7, 4 cores 8 threads, 4.2GHz boosted</li>
<li>8GB RAM plus 20GB I added</li>
<li>1/2TB SSD</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Recommendation:</b> I would recommend this if you&rsquo;re interested in a portable, powerful laptop and you don&rsquo;t care much about build quality. I will not try to determine whether the newest model matches up to this one and is worth the price. That being said, if mine broke I would buy the newest Lemur Pro for $1600, with the default 12c/14t i5 4.3GHz boosted, 8GB RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD, and 2.2lb weight.
</p>

<p>
<b>Pros:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Great daily driver</li>
<li>Lightweight (2.1lb)</li>
<li>Small form factor</li>
<li>Small screen bezels</li>
<li>Powerful</li>
<li>I easily added more RAM</li>
<li>Easy disassembly for maintenance
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Adding RAM (once)</li>
<li>Replacing batteries (twice)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Great daily battery capacity</li>
<li>Reliably handles double- and triple-monitor setups over Thunderbolt.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I use the Dell <code>WD22TB4</code> ThunderBolt 4 Dock</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Touchpad recognizes gestures with good enough reliability.</li>
<li>Charges fast on both the barrel and Thunderbolt ports</li>
<li>Has dedicated HDMI port</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Cons:</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Battery health could be better.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It begins to inflate after ~1 year and by 2 years it&rsquo;s inflated enough to push the keyboard up at least 1/8 inch.</li>
<li>As it inflates the capacity drops noticeably.</li>
<li>You will have to buy a new one which will run you around $150.</li>
<li>The cable for both the new batteries I&rsquo;ve received has been too long so I&rsquo;ve had to wedge it against the battery and motherboard. Note that the batteries weren&rsquo;t aftermarket, they were from System76 directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keyboard shows noticeable wear and tear, but perhaps this is expected for the build quality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My <code>E</code> key has fallen off. The plastic scissor mechanism clip, which holds the key to the keyboard, broke.</li>
<li>The touchpad coating has worn off in two places.</li>
<li>The coating on 26 of the keyboard keys has begun to wear off. Some keys have maybe 10% surface area worn while others have 80%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>My right USB port doesn&rsquo;t detect hard drives, but the left USB port and the Thunderbolt port do.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I may have damaged it by shorting the \(\pm5\text{V}\) output in an electronics project, but I feel like it should have better protection?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The rubber feet broke off quickly, maybe within 1 month of usage. They just can&rsquo;t withstand the shear force imposed by sliding the laptop back and forth, which I do a lot.</li>
<li>The sticker rubbed off the bottom and now I don&rsquo;t know my laptop&rsquo;s serial number.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The SN should be hardcoded in software or engraved somewhere.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The upper 1/4 inch strip of the touchpad, closest to the keyboard, doesn&rsquo;t respond.</li>
<li>The speakers aren&rsquo;t good quality or that loud
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>After 4 years the left speaker started to sound really bad when playing bass</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re usable when you need audio output and don&rsquo;t have other options, but for any consistent use (Zoom meetings, Youtube videos) you&rsquo;ll wish you had better speakers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
