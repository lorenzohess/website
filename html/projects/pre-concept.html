Digital Lab Notebooks backed by Git and public-key cryptography
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Problem:</span> lab notebooks are essential research tools. They track experimental procedure and implemented sequence, lab notes, and the genesis of creative ideas. Writing on paper, however, even in non-erasable ink, does not provide any integrity to the data and metadata that lab notebooks must track. A written note can be altered after-the-fact, providing no assurance as to the chronology of the lab notes or their data integrity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Solution:</span> use a digital lab notebook with Git to track chronology and preserve integrity as well as GPG to provide a second layer of assurance, proof of digital notebook ownership, and privacy and security via encryption.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Implementation:</span> a program manages your lab notebooks starting with a root directory, which contains <code>notebooks</code>. Each <code>notebook</code> is its own Git repo and receives its own digital signatures. Users can decide the semantics of a <code>notebook</code>, for example whether one notebook corresponds to one laboratory, to one day of work, to one lab session, to one lab assistant. These can of course be mixed and matched and do not affect how the program works. All the program does is track each notebook with Git and GPG.
</p>

<p>
If a user keeps a hand-written lab notebook, then the program can use photos of the pages as evidence. They could be OCRed to provide basic search functionality.
